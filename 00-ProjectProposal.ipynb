    "Academic demands are one of the most significant contributors to university students having consistently high levels of stress. Stress among college students has been linked to harmful outcomes such as reduced academic performance, mental health challenges, and even sleep disruption. While research on stress levels among students has been popular and important, there has been a shift towards understanding how stress can fluctuate over time within an academic term. These patterns matter because stress is not static, it rises and falls in response to pressures like deadlines and exams. Understanding when stress peaks can inform institutional policies and academic support services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research that tracks students over time generally finds that stress rises during high demand periods, especially around midterms and finals, rather than remaining constant throughout a whole term. An example of this is a longitudinal study of incoming college students that reported higher average stress during examination periods which linked higher stress to poor sleep quality and negative emotions.\n",
    "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6122850/ The last decade has seen an increase in the use of higher-frequency measurement designs that are suited to detecting within term fluctuations. Research using this approach argues that near real time sampling can capture short-lived spikes and recoveries.This provides a template for aligning stress measurements with specific academic events. This shift motivates data research that models stress as a time varying outcome rather than a single static stress level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last decade has also seen growth in research connecting academic structure to student well-being outcomes. Studies on workload distribution suggest that when academic demands are compressed into shorter time frames, students report greater time pressure and fewer opportunities to recover between assessments. This indicates that not only the amount of academic work, but the pacing of the work, influences how stress develops across a term. Because of this, the organization of an academic calendar may shape when stress begins to rise and how quickly it intensifies during the semester or quarter.\n",
    "Comparisons between quarter and semester systems provide a useful framework for examining these differences. Quarter systems typically involve faster content coverage and more frequent transitions between courses while semester systems allow longer adjustment periods and a more extended timeline for assignments and exams. Although both systems include predictable stress points during midterms and finals, the compressed structure of the quarter system may lead to earlier spikes in stress.\n",

    "We hypothesize that students in quarter-system universities will experience higher stress earlier in the academic term compared to students in semester-system universities. Additionally, we expect student stress levels to increase more rapidly over time in quarter-system institutions, reflecting the compressed academic pacing as opposed to the slower structure of semester systems.. Finally, we hypothesize that the emphasis of midterms and finals on quarter systems will partially mediate the relationship between academic system structure and student stress.\n"

    "\n",
    "> We recognize that datasets on student stress may be subject to collection bias or self-selection bias. The self-selection bias could be that students experiencing higher or lower stress may be more likely to respond and self-report bias. Steps to mitigate bias is to acknowledge the limitations and interpret results carefully, we will avoid strong causal claims and overgeneralization to all students in datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",

    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",

    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The possible source of biases could be that students who are filling out the survey or are having their data collected may be less stressed or be a specific population in the school. We will be sure to address/mitigate this bias by collecting data that is random or make sure we are aware of this while explaining our results. There may also be less data available for one academic system and another, with a quarter and semester system. These limitations will be discussed when interpreting any observed differences between quarter and semester systems.\n",

    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will communicate that any findings may have confounds and could not be causation. There are limitations of our data as it could be limited to few universities, with our limited datasets that are relevant. This may also be biases of the model, with possible evaluation biases due to few datasets that represent what we are researching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
